There are various projects supporting a scroll wheel Mouse on the Amiga.
The BEC controller in the AmigaPCI currently implements scroll wheel by
sending keyboard scroll codes directly on the Keyboard interface, bypassing
the need for any custom driver on the Amiga.

    This project uses an Arduino to convert a PS/2 style mouse to
    Amiga mouse. The pin for the middle mouse button is used for
    message between the Amiga driver and the Arduino:
    1. The driver on the Amiga drives Button 3 (PotX - middle mouse button)
       low.
    2. This triggers an interrupt on the Arduino.
    3. If neither the left mouse button nor the right mouse button are
       being held, then the Arduino firmware will drive button 1, 3, and 2
       as a 3-bit code to the Amiga.

          2    0   1   0   Wheel up
          3    0   1   1   Middle button down
          4    1   0   0   Middle button up
    4. The Arduino will release the code after 20 microseconds and not
       assert again for another 18 milliseconds.

    Limitations:
        The scroll wheel does not work when left or right Amiga mouse
        button is being held.
