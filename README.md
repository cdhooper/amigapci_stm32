AmigaPCI STM32 firmware

STM32F205 firmware for the AmigaPCI project

The AmigaPCI embedded STM32 MCU is responsible for Amiga keyboard,
mouse, RTC, power supply, single fan, and board reset control.

This firmware implements a command line which is unavailable to
the user unless they connect a TTL serial device (such as FT232R).
